# weatherwebapp
Hey everone,
This is my first project.
Its a weather web app.
You can see the final result on the link.txt file.
In this project I created a simple web app that tells the forecast for the common days by a city input.
The web app is in Hebrew but I am sure it can be understandable for everyone.

I would like to hear your comments.
